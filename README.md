# Portfolio Website V.1

A replacement for my existing WordPress website.
Built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Future Plans

* Database integration - 
The current V.1 includes hardcoded project/sample data that is simply passed as props from the list components. Now that I have a better sense of the content and data shape that I need to work with, I will update my schema file and seed the ClearDB instance that I currently have deployed on Heroku. 

* Content Management -
I plan to build out an admin portal that will provide content management system features. This will include the ability to add/change/delete projects, and change contact / bio information from a user interface.
